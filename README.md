# Java: Object-Oriented Design Patterns Library

## 📌 Project Purpose
This repository serves as a technical showcase for enterprise software architecture. It focuses on the practical implementation of classic design patterns to solve common software engineering challenges.

## 🎓 Academic Context
* **Institution:** Developed alongside Computer Science studies at **Maestro College**.
* **Core Principles:** Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, and Polymorphism.
* **Goal:** To demonstrate a transition from academic theory into professional **Tech and Management** standards.

## 🏗️ Patterns Implemented
* **Creational:** Factory Method, Singleton (Focusing on thread-safety).
* **Behavioral:** Observer Pattern (For event-driven logic).
* **Structural:** Adapter Pattern (For interface compatibility).

## 🧪 Quality Assurance
As a professional **AI Code Quality Analyst**, I treat these patterns as benchmarks for clean code. Every implementation is audited for logic flow and adherence to SOLID principles.
